# Project Inspector Assignment - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the project inspector assignment feature. This feature allows each project to be assigned to a specific project inspector, and ensures that project inspectors can only view and manage projects that have been assigned to them.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Migrations

#### Migration 1: `20250101000001_add_project_inspector_assignment.sql`
- Added `project_inspector_id` column to the `projects` table
- Created index for better query performance
- Updated RLS policies:
  - Project inspectors can only view projects assigned to them (replaced "view all" policy)
  - Updated accomplishment_reports policies to check both project_manager_id and project_inspector_id
  - Updated progress_photos policies to restrict inspectors to their assigned projects only
  - Maintained separate superadmin policies for full access

#### Migration 2: `20250101000002_update_reports_view_with_inspector.sql`
- Updated `accomplishment_reports_with_details` view to include:
  - `project_manager_id` field from projects table
  - `project_inspector_id` field from projects table
- This allows the reports management page to filter reports based on inspector assignments
- View maintains security_invoker setting for RLS enforcement

### 2. TypeScript Type Updates

#### Projects Types
**File**: `src/types/projects.ts`

- Added `ProjectInspector` interface (matching `ProjectManager` structure)
- Updated `Project` interface to include:
  - `project_inspector_id: string | null`
  - `project_inspector: ProjectInspector | null`
- Updated `CreateProjectData` to include optional `project_inspector_id`
- Updated `UpdateProjectData` to include optional `project_inspector_id`
- Updated `ProjectFilters` to include optional `project_inspector_id` for filtering

#### Accomplishment Reports Types
**File**: `src/types/accomplishment-reports.ts`

- Updated `AccomplishmentReport` interface to include:
  - `project_manager_id?: string` - for filtering by project manager
  - `project_inspector_id?: string` - for filtering by project inspector
- These fields come from the updated `accomplishment_reports_with_details` view

### 3. Service Layer Updates
**File**: `src/services/projects/project.service.ts`

- Added `ProjectInspector` to imports
- Updated all project queries to include project inspector data:
  - `getProjects()` - includes project_inspector join
  - `getProjectById()` - includes project_inspector join
  - `createProject()` - returns project with inspector data
  - `updateProject()` - returns project with inspector data
- Added filtering support for `project_inspector_id` in `getProjects()`
- Added new method: `getAvailableProjectInspectors()` - fetches all active project inspectors

### 4. React Hook Updates

#### useProjects Hook
**File**: `src/hooks/useProjects.ts`

- Imported `useRBAC` hook to access user information
- Added automatic filtering logic:
  - When a project inspector is logged in, automatically filters projects to show only their assigned projects
  - Filter is applied transparently without modifying the component code
  - Uses `user?.role === 'project_inspector'` to detect inspector role
  - Adds `project_inspector_id: user.user_id` to filters automatically

#### useAccomplishmentReports Hook
**File**: `src/hooks/useAccomplishmentReports.ts`

- Updated `useAllAccomplishmentReports` hook with role-based filtering
- Added `useRBAC` import to access user information
- Implemented smart filtering logic:
  - **Superadmins**: See ALL reports (no filtering applied)
  - **HR**: See ALL reports (no filtering applied)
  - **Project Inspectors**: See ONLY reports for projects where they are assigned as inspector
  - **Project Managers**: See ONLY reports for projects where they are assigned as manager
- Filtering is based on `report.project_inspector_id === user.user_id`
- Works in conjunction with database RLS policies for defense in depth
- Transparent to components using the hook

### 5. Form Component Updates

#### ProjectCreateForm
**File**: `src/components/projects/ProjectCreateForm.tsx`

- Added `ProjectInspector` to imports
- Updated props to include `projectInspectors: ProjectInspector[]`
- Updated form state to include `project_inspector_id`
- Added Project Inspector dropdown selector (similar to Site Engineer selector)
- Form shows both Site Engineer and Project Inspector selection fields

#### ProjectEditForm
**File**: `src/components/projects/ProjectEditForm.tsx`

- Added `ProjectInspector` to imports
- Updated props to include `projectInspectors: ProjectInspector[]`
- Updated form state to include `project_inspector_id`
- Added Project Inspector dropdown selector
- Form properly loads existing project inspector assignment
- Both fields are optional and can be set to "Unassigned"

### 6. Dashboard Page Updates
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

- Added `ProjectInspector` to imports
- Added state for `projectInspectors`
- Updated `loadAssignees` function to fetch both managers and inspectors in parallel using `Promise.all`
- Passed `projectInspectors` prop to both `ProjectCreateForm` and `ProjectEditForm`

### 7. RBAC Permission Updates
**File**: `src/types/rbac.ts`

- Added new permission: `view_assigned_projects`
- Updated `project_inspector` role permissions to include:
  - `view_assigned_projects` - explicitly states they view only assigned projects
  - `manage_uploads` - can upload reports and photos for assigned projects

### 8. Documentation Updates
**File**: `RBAC_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

- Updated Project Inspector role description with new permissions and restrictions
- Added Projects Table Structure documentation
- Enhanced RLS Policies section with detailed project access control information
- Added comprehensive "Project Inspector Assignment Feature" section covering:
  - Overview of the feature
  - Database changes
  - Application features
  - Usage examples
  - Security benefits

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Filtering
- Project inspectors automatically see only their assigned projects
- No manual permission checks needed in components
- Filter is applied at the data fetching level via `useProjects` hook

### 2. Database-Level Security
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies enforce access control at the database level
- Inspectors cannot bypass restrictions through direct database access
- All queries automatically respect the RLS policies

### 3. Clean Architecture
- Separation of concerns with proper service layer
- Type-safe operations throughout the application
- Consistent patterns following existing project manager implementation

### 4. User-Friendly Interface
- Simple dropdown selection for assigning project inspectors
- Both Site Engineer and Project Inspector can be assigned independently
- Optional assignments - can be left as "Unassigned"
- Clear labeling in the UI

### 5. Comprehensive Security
- Database-level enforcement via RLS policies
- Automatic filtering in the application layer
- Proper TypeScript typing prevents incorrect usage
- Audit trail via created_by and updated_by fields

## How It Works

### For Superadmins/HR:
1. Create or edit a project
2. Select a Project Inspector from the dropdown (optional)
3. Save the project
4. The inspector will now see this project in their dashboard

### For Project Inspectors:
1. Log in to the dashboard
2. **Dashboard**: Automatically see only projects assigned to them
3. **Accomplishment Reports Page**: Automatically see only reports for projects assigned to them
4. Can upload accomplishment reports and progress photos for their assigned projects
5. Cannot see or access projects/reports assigned to other inspectors

### For Superadmins:
1. Log in to the dashboard
2. **Dashboard**: See ALL projects (no filtering)
3. **Accomplishment Reports Page**: See ALL reports from all projects
4. Can approve/reject any report
5. Can assign/reassign project inspectors to any project

### Database Flow:
```
User Login → RBAC Check → Project Inspector Role Detected
↓
useProjects Hook → Automatic Filter Applied
↓
ProjectService.getProjects({ project_inspector_id: user.user_id })
↓
Supabase Query with RLS → Returns Only Assigned Projects
↓
Dashboard Shows Filtered Projects
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run database migrations: `supabase db push`
- [ ] Verify RLS policies in Supabase dashboard
- [ ] Create test users with project_inspector role
- [ ] Assign projects to different inspectors
- [ ] Log in as inspector and verify they only see assigned projects
- [ ] Test creating new projects with inspector assignment
- [ ] Test editing projects to change inspector assignment
- [ ] Test uploading reports/photos as inspector
- [ ] **Test accomplishment reports page - inspectors should only see reports for their assigned projects**
- [ ] Verify superadmins can see all projects and reports
- [ ] Verify HR can see all projects and reports
- [ ] Test unassigning inspector from a project

## Migration Steps

1. **Run the Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   cd supabase
   supabase db push
   ```

2. **Restart the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Create Test Data** (optional):
   - Create users with `project_inspector` role
   - Assign them to test projects
   - Verify filtering works correctly

4. **Verify Functionality**:
   - Test as superadmin (should see all projects)
   - Test as project inspector (should see only assigned projects)
   - Test creating/editing projects with inspector assignments

## Notes

- The implementation follows the same pattern as `project_manager_id` for consistency
- All changes are backward compatible - existing projects without inspectors continue to work
- The feature is opt-in - projects don't require inspector assignment
- Database constraints ensure referential integrity (inspector must be a valid user)
- RLS policies provide defense in depth - multiple layers of security

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-Inspector Support**: Allow multiple inspectors per project
2. **Inspector Dashboard**: Dedicated dashboard view for inspectors
3. **Assignment Notifications**: Email notifications when assigned to a project
4. **Assignment History**: Track inspector assignment changes over time
5. **Workload Balancing**: Auto-suggest inspectors based on current workload
6. **Inspector Reports**: Generate reports on inspector activity and project coverage
